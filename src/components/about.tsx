        After graduating with a degree in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Accounting</span>, I decided to pursue my
        passion for programming. I enrolled in a coding bootcamp and learned{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full-stack web development</span>.{" "}
        <span className="italic">My favorite part of programming</span> is the
        problem-solving aspect. I <span className="underline">love</span> the
        feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack
        is{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">
          React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB
        </span>
        . I am also familiar with TypeScript and Prisma. I am always looking to
        learn new technologies. I am currently looking for a{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full-time position</span> as a software
        developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="italic">When I'm not coding</span>, I enjoy playing
        video games, watching movies, and playing with my dog. I also enjoy{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">learning new things</span>. I am currently
        learning about{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">history and philosophy</span>. I'm also
        learning how to play the guitar.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a loving husband and father who enjoys spending time with my family, engaging in outdoor activities, working on cars, and creating/building things in my workshop. I am also passionate about technology and enjoy tinkering with my homelab and coding for fun. These hobbies have taught me valuable problem-solving skills and a desire to constantly learn and improve. As a well-rounded individual, I bring a unique perspective and a can-do attitude to every task.
